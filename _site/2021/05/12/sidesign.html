<p>The second sign was smaller and faced North.</p>

<p>The side sign was a war between what I wanted and what I could afford.</p>

<p>The original idea was turn the lighted cabinet into a marquee with interchangeable letters. 
But several sign places would not take the project, or were going to charge me $1000 more than just the vanyle coverings of the existing light boxes.</p>
