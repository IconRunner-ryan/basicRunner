&lt;p&gt;I got caught up with so many fancy add ons, from gold foil to embssed masking. 
Some of them were more expensive than I could afford.
Others were above my skill level to draft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I went with a 4 color business card with UV exposure to make the colors pop.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>recode</name></author><summary type="html">Business Card design is always fun.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Frontsign</title><link href="iconrunner-ryan.github.io/basicRunner/2021/05/12/frontsign.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Frontsign" /><published>2021-05-12T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-05-12T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>iconrunner-ryan.github.io/basicRunner/2021/05/12/frontsign</id><content type="html" xml:base="iconrunner-ryan.github.io/basicRunner/2021/05/12/frontsign.html">&lt;p&gt;The front sign was a challenge. It was 10 feet wide, and visible from far away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed to make sure the text was large enough to be seen from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The font was chosen first. I really liked the thickness of the Racing One font for the main Icon Runner text. It was thick enough for me to add text effects and word art to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The colors were picked out second. There are 5 individual colors chosen for the gradient.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>recode</name></author><summary type="html">The front sign was a challenge.

&lt;p&gt;The side sign was a war between what I wanted and what I could afford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original idea was turn the lighted cabinet into a marquee with interchangeable letters. 
But several sign places would not take the project, or were going to charge me $1000 more than just the vanyle coverings of the existing light boxes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>recode</name></author><summary type="html">The second sign was smaller and faced North.</summary></entry></feed>
