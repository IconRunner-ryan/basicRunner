The front sign was a challenge. It was 10 feet wide, and visible from far away. 

I needed to make sure the text was large enough to be seen from anywhere.

The font was chosen first. I really liked the thickness of the Racing One font for the main Icon Runner text. It was thick enough for me to add text effects and word art to it.

The colors were picked out second. There are 5 individual colors chosen for the gradient.
