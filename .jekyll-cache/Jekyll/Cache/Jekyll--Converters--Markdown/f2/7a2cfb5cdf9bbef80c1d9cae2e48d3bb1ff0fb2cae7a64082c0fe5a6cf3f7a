I"Ä<p>The front sign was a challenge. It was 10 feet wide, and visible from far away.</p>

<p>I needed to make sure the text was large enough to be seen from anywhere.</p>

<p>The font was chosen first. I really liked the thickness of the Racing One font for the main Icon Runner text. It was thick enough for me to add text effects and word art to it.</p>

<p>The colors were picked out second. There are 5 individual colors chosen for the gradient.</p>
